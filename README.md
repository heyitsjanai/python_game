# Poseidon's Trident Adventure
Simple **Python** application that gets user input to navigate a maze.

## Learning Points
- Python
- dictionaries
- for loops
- user input validation
- error catching

I'll eventually be making edits to optimize this code &
create an even better version of this game, but it is functional
& fun to play!

Try & find Poseidon's Trident that was stolen by a sea monster.
User must first collect all 6 weapons to become strong enough
to defeat the Leviathan.
